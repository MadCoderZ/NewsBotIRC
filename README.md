# Java IRC Bot with RSS feed reader
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MadCoderZ/NewsBotIRC.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MadCoderZ/NewsBotIRC)

This project has been entirely written in the Java language, so it basically can
run on computers that are able to run Java code.

We focus on handling memory in the best possible way, keeping a clean code,
always trying to use best programming practices, stability and reliability.

Its purpose is to fetch from different sources (RSS and Atom) and publish them
on an IRC channel on a specific IRC server. Think of it as a RSS client reader
but with IRC support.

Everybody is welcome to cooperate, add new functions by creating a fork in
GitHub, and also fix issues or propose features or modifications. We listen to
the community and we want to keep working on it as a hobby.
